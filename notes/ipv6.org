* IPv6

First 48 bits - Global routing prefix (GRP)
- Subdivide each GRP-unique network into site-specific networks
- First hextet to a regional internet registry
- Second hextet to an ISP
- Third hextet to client
Last 16 bits - Subnet ID
Next 64 bits - Interface ID

2003::/3
- Global use

fc00::/7
- Unique local address


* Address Categories

Unicast addresses

Multicast addresses
- ff00::/8

Anycast addresses
- group of nodes listening to one same address
- goes to the nearest node listening on the address
  - node with latency between origin and destination
- increases redundancy, geolocate services

* Key Advantages

** Simplified Header Format for More Efficient Routing

Motivation: Header within IPv4 are mandatory yet rarely used

IPv6 headers are extensible, can be added without breaking backward compatibility
Lessen the loads on the router as headers are minimal (can eliminate the need to checksum every hop)

** Stateless Address Auto-configuration

Motivation: Admin would need to administer IPv4 addresses to each node on a network or rely on a
service to dynamically assign addresses

IPv6 addresses are derived from stateless address auto-configuration (SLAAC)
Can only work with routers that can respond with router advertisement packets
- contain information clients need to automatically configure their IPv6 address

1. Connect to an IPv6 network, node solicit the router for its network address parameters using Neighbour
   Discovery Protocol (NDP)
2. NDP uses ICMP for Router Solicitation (RS)
3. Node receives reply with 64-bit network address
4. Node derives the 64-bit host portion of its IPv6 address on its own using 48-bit MAC address
5. Node appends 16-bit hex FFFE to the first three octets of the MAC address (OUI)
6. Node appends remaining three octets of the MAC address with NIC

** Native IPsec Support

Allows multiple nodes to dynamically create secure connections between each other
