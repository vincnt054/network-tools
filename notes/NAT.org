* NAT

Requires a device (firewall, load balancer, or router) that can keep track of incoming and
outgoing traffic and properly route incoming traffic to correct node

1. NAT device opens its own connection to destination host using public IP, preserving
the client's socket address port
- If client address port is being used, choose a random port for its socket address
2. NAT device sends the request to the destination host and receives the response on its
   public IP
   - Translates socket address to the client socket address that established the connection

Host outside NAT device's private network cannot establish incoming connections
- Only clients in the private network may establish connection through NAT device
